<h1 class="NH">Git 2.5.2(2) Release Notes</h1>
<p>Last update: 13 September 2015</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>These release notes describe issues specific to the Git for Windows release. The release notes covering the history of the core git commands can be found <a href="https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/Documentation/RelNotes">in the Git project</a>.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a> for further details about Git including ports to other operating systems. Git for Windows is hosted at <a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/">https://git-for-windows.github.io/</a>.</p>

<h1>Known issues</h1>

<ul>
<li>Special permissions (and Windows Vista or later) are required when cloning repositories with symbolic links, therefore support for symbolic links is disabled by default. Use <code>git clone -c core.symlinks=true &lt;URL&gt;</code> to enable it, see details <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/Symbolic-Links">here</a>.</li>
<li>If configured to use Plink, you will have to connect with <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">putty</a> first and accept the host key.</li>
<li>Some console programs interact correctly with MinTTY only when called through <code>winpty</code> (e.g. the Python console needs to be started as <code>winpty python</code> instead of just <code>python</code>).</li>
<li><a href="http://curl.haxx.se">cURL</a> uses <code>$HOME/_netrc</code> instead of <code>$HOME/.netrc</code>.</li>
<li><p>If you specify command-line options starting with a slash, POSIX-to-Windows path conversion will kick in converting e.g. "<code>/usr/bin/bash.exe</code>" to "<code>C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\bash.exe</code>". When that is not desired -- e.g. "<code>--upload-pack=/opt/git/bin/git-upload-pack</code>" or "<code>-L/regex/</code>" -- you need to set the environment variable <code>MSYS_NO_PATHCONV</code> temporarily, like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 git blame -L/pathconv/ msys2_path_conv.cc</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, you can double the first slash to avoid POSIX-to-Windows path conversion.</p></li>
<li>Git for Windows will not allow commits containing DOS-style truncated 8.3-format filenames ending with a tilde and digit, such as <code>mydocu~1.txt</code>. A workaround is to call <code>git config core.protectNTFS false</code>, which is not advised. Instead, add a rule to .gitignore to ignore the file(s), or rename the file(s).</li>
<li>Many Windows programs (including the Windows Explorer) have problems with directory trees nested so deeply that the absolute path is longer than 260 characters. Therefore, Git for Windows refuses to check out such files by default. You can overrule this default by setting <code>core.longPaths</code>, e.g. <code>git clone -c core.longPaths=true ...</code>.</li>
<li>Some commands are not yet supported on Windows and excluded from the installation.</li>
<li>As Git for Windows is shipped without Python support, all Git commands requiring Python are not yet supported; e.g. <code>git p4</code>.</li>
<li>The Quick Launch icon will only be installed for the user running setup (typically the Administrator). This is a technical restriction and will not change.</li>
</ul>
